# bis-locational-statistics


The goal of this repository is to pull the latest release of the BIS locational banking statistics (LBS). The LBS measure international banking activity from a residence perspective, focusing on the location of the banking office. The LBS capture outstanding claims (financial assets) and liabilities of internationally active banks located in reporting countries on counterparties residing in more than 200 countries.

To pull the data simply run `R/lbs-data-pull.R` which outputs `data/locational-statistics.xlsx`.
